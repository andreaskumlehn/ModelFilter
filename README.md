# ModelFilter

Simple Java library to filter instances of model classes according to a 'View'. It supports the filtering of complex object graphs and has support for collections and arrays.

**Note:** Model classes that should be filtered need to have a default constructor.

See `kreutzer.modelfilter.example.ModelFilterExample` for an example on how to use the ModelFilter library.
